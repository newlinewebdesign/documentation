# Klarna Payments

Klarna is a global payment provider that lets shoppers choose how they want to pay — pay now with a card or bank transfer, pay later in one interest-free installment, or split the cost over several months. Adding Klarna to your J2Commerce store can reduce cart abandonment and increase average order value by giving customers flexible, low-friction payment options at checkout.

The plugin supports two checkout modes: **Klarna Payments**, which embeds a Klarna widget directly on your checkout page, and **Hosted Payment Page (HPP)**, which redirects shoppers to a Klarna-hosted payment screen. Both modes support refunds, order status automation, saved payment methods for returning customers, and subscriptions.

## Requirements

- J2Commerce 6.0 or later installed and active
- Joomla 6.0 or later
- A Klarna merchant account (see below)
- Your site must be publicly reachable over HTTPS for Klarna callbacks to work

## Installation

This plugin is a separate add-on available from the [J2Commerce Extensions Store](https://www.j2commerce.com). It is not included with the core J2Commerce 6 component.

1. Purchase and download the `payment_klarna.zip` package from the J2Commerce website.
2. Go to **System** -> **Install** -> **Extensions** in your Joomla admin.
3. Upload the `payment_klarna.zip` package file.
4. The plugin installs and enables automatically.

## Set Up a Klarna Merchant Account

If you already have Klarna API credentials, skip to [Configure the Plugin](#configure-the-plugin).

1. Go to [klarna.com](https://www.klarna.com) and sign up for a merchant account for your region.
2. Once approved, log into the [Klarna Merchant Portal](https://portal.klarna.com).
3. Navigate to **Settings** -> **API credentials** (or **Klarna Payments** -> **Credentials**).
4. Note your **API Username (UID)** and generate an **API Password**. Both are needed below.
5. For the on-site Klarna Payments widget, also note your **Client Identifier** (starts with `klarna_test_client_` in sandbox, similar prefix for live).
6. For sandbox/playground testing, Klarna provides a separate set of credentials — keep both sets handy.

:::tip

Klarna's available payment methods (Pay Now, Pay Later, Pay Over Time) vary by country and merchant agreement. If a particular method does not appear at checkout, check your Klarna Merchant Portal to confirm it is activated for your account and region.

## Configure the Plugin

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Klarna plugin settings page — full view -->

### Display Settings

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Display Name** | The name shown to shoppers at checkout — e.g., "Pay with Klarna" | `Klarna` |
| **Display Image** | Optional logo or badge shown next to the payment option | _(none)_ |

### Checkout Mode

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Checkout Mode** | Choose **Klarna Payments (on-site widget — recommended)** to keep shoppers on your checkout page, or **Hosted Payment Page (redirect)** to send shoppers to a Klarna-hosted payment screen. |

:::info

**Klarna Payments (on-site widget)** keeps the shopper on your checkout page and renders Klarna's payment UI inside an iframe — it requires the Client Identifier in addition to your API username and password. **Hosted Payment Page** redirects shoppers off-site; only your API username and password are needed.

:::

#### HPP Payment Methods (Hosted Payment Page only)

When **Checkout Mode** is set to **Hosted Payment Page**, you can restrict which payment options appear on the Klarna page. Leave this blank to show all available options for your account.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Pay Now | Immediate payment by card or bank transfer |
| Pay Later | Single interest-free deferred payment |
| Pay Over Time | Installment payments spread over several months |
| Direct Debit | Bank debit payment |
| Direct Bank Transfer | Real-time bank transfer |

### Transaction Type

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Authorize and Capture** | Charges the shopper immediately when the order is placed. Recommended for most stores. |
| **Authorize Only** | Places a hold on the shopper's payment method but does not charge it. You capture manually from the order view when you are ready to ship. |

### Region

Select the Klarna API region that matches your merchant account. Using the wrong region will result in authentication errors.

| Region | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| Europe (EU) | Your Klarna account is registered in a European country |
| North America (NA) | Your Klarna account is registered in the US or Canada |
| Oceania (OC) | Your Klarna account is registered in Australia or New Zealand |

### Sandbox Mode

Toggle **Sandbox Mode** on while you are testing. In sandbox mode, no real payments are processed and Klarna uses its playground environment. Turn this off before going live.

:::warning

The **Sandbox** credentials (username, password, and client identifier) are separate from your live credentials. Fill in both sets so you can switch between environments without losing your live keys.

:::

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Klarna credentials fields showing sandbox vs live sections -->

### API Credentials

Two sets of credentials are available — fill in both. The plugin automatically uses whichever set matches the current **Sandbox Mode** setting.

**Live credentials** (shown when Sandbox Mode is Off):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **API Username (UID)** | Your live Klarna API username — typically a UUID starting with a region prefix such as `PK99999_...` |
| **API Password** | Your live Klarna API password — starts with `klarna_...` |
| **Client Identifier** | Your live Klarna Payments JS SDK client identifier (required for on-site widget mode only) |

**Sandbox credentials** (shown when Sandbox Mode is On):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Sandbox API Username** | Your playground/sandbox Klarna API username |
| **Sandbox API Password** | Your playground/sandbox Klarna API password |
| **Sandbox Client Identifier** | Your sandbox Klarna Payments JS SDK client identifier (on-site widget mode only) |

### Callback URLs

The plugin displays read-only callback URLs that you register in your Klarna Merchant Portal so Klarna can notify your store of payment events. There are three URLs:

- **Authorization Callback** — called when a shopper authorizes payment
- **Fraud Notification** — called when Klarna flags a transaction for review
- **HPP Status Update** — called when a Hosted Payment Page session status changes (HPP mode only)

Copy each URL using the **Copy** button and paste it into the corresponding field in your Klarna Merchant Portal.

:::info

Callback URLs are not available on local development environments. Use a tunneling tool such as ngrok to test callbacks on a local site.

:::

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Callback URLs section showing the three URLs with Copy buttons -->

### Subscriptions and Saved Payment Methods

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Enable Subscriptions** | Allow Klarna Customer Tokens to be created for recurring subscription payments. Requires the Subscription Product app to also be installed and enabled. | No |

### Order Status Automation

Control which order status J2Commerce applies at each point in the payment lifecycle.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Surcharge Name** | Label shown to the customer — e.g., "Klarna fee" |

## How Checkout Works

### Klarna Payments (On-Site Widget)

When a shopper selects Klarna at checkout:

1. The plugin creates a Klarna payment session using your API credentials.
2. The Klarna Payments JavaScript widget loads in the checkout page — shoppers see their available Klarna options (Pay Now, Pay Later, Pay Over Time) directly on your site.
3. The shopper selects their preferred option and authorizes the payment within the widget.
4. The plugin captures the authorization (or leaves it as authorized-only, depending on your **Transaction Type** setting) and places the order.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Klarna Payments widget rendered at checkout -->

### Hosted Payment Page (HPP)

When a shopper selects Klarna at checkout:

1. The plugin creates a Klarna HPP session and redirects the shopper to Klarna's hosted payment page.
2. The shopper completes their payment on Klarna's site.
3. Klarna redirects the shopper back to your store and sends a callback to confirm the payment result.
4. The plugin updates the order status accordingly.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Klarna Hosted Payment Page with payment method options -->

## Managing Orders

Once a Klarna payment is placed, the J2Commerce order view shows additional payment actions depending on your **Transaction Type** setting.

### Capture an Authorized Payment

When **Transaction Type** is set to **Authorize Only**, a **Capture** button appears in the order view. Click **Capture** to collect the funds from the shopper. This is the step that actually charges the customer.

### Void an Authorization

Before capturing, you can click **Void** to cancel the authorization entirely. This releases the hold on the shopper's payment method without charging them. Voiding cannot be undone.

### Issue a Refund

After a payment is captured, click **Refund** in the order view to return funds to the shopper. You can issue:

- A **full refund** for the entire captured amount
- A **partial refund** for a specific amount (enter the amount in the refund field)

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Order view showing Klarna Capture, Void, and Refund buttons -->

### Charge a Saved Klarna Token

If a customer has a saved Klarna payment method and **Allow Saved Payment Methods** is enabled, an admin can charge that saved method directly from the order view using **Charge Saved Klarna Token**.

## Saved Payment Methods

When **Allow Saved Payment Methods** is enabled, logged-in customers see a **Saved Klarna Methods** section at checkout after their first Klarna purchase. They can:

- Select a previously saved method for faster checkout
- Choose **Use a new payment method** to use a different Klarna option
- Delete saved methods from their account area

## Subscriptions

When **Enable Subscriptions** is turned on and the Subscription Product app is also installed, Klarna Customer Tokens are created at the time of the initial subscription purchase. These tokens are used to charge renewal orders automatically without the customer returning to checkout.

:::info

Subscription support requires the **Subscription Product** app plugin, which is a separate add-on available from the J2Commerce website.

:::

## Tips

- **Start with Sandbox Mode on** — Test the full checkout flow, including refunds and callbacks, before switching to live credentials.
- **Register all three callback URLs** — Missing even one URL in your Klarna Merchant Portal can prevent orders from updating correctly.
- **Use "Authorize Only" for pre-orders or made-to-order goods** — Capture the payment when you are ready to ship rather than charging the customer up front.
- **Restrict by geozone if needed** — If Klarna is only approved for certain countries in your merchant agreement, use the **Geozone Restriction** setting to hide it from ineligible customers automatically.
- **Enable debug logging only when troubleshooting** — Debug logs can contain sensitive API responses; disable this in production.

## Troubleshooting

### Klarna Widget Does Not Appear at Checkout

**Cause:** Missing or incorrect API credentials, wrong region selected, or the Client Identifier is blank (on-site widget mode).

**Solution:**

1. Go to **J2Commerce** -> **Payments** -> **Payment Methods** -> **Klarna**.
2. Confirm **Sandbox Mode** matches your credential type — sandbox credentials only work in sandbox mode, and live credentials only work with sandbox mode off.
3. Verify the **API Username**, **API Password**, and **Client Identifier** are filled in correctly.
4. Confirm the **Region** matches the country your Klarna merchant account is registered in.
5. Enable **Debug Logging**, place a test order, then check **System** -> **System Information** -> **PHP Information** or the Joomla log file for API error details.

### Orders Stay in Pending After Klarna Payment

**Cause:** Klarna callbacks are not reaching your server — the callback URLs may not be registered in your Klarna Merchant Portal, or your server is blocking the requests.

**Solution:**

1. Open the plugin settings and copy the **Authorization Callback** URL.
2. Log into your Klarna Merchant Portal and confirm that URL is registered as a callback endpoint.
3. Confirm your site is publicly reachable over HTTPS (callbacks do not work on local development environments without a tunneling tool).
4. Enable **Debug Logging** and check your server logs to see whether Klarna is sending requests and whether they are succeeding.

### "Klarna API credentials are not configured" Error

**Cause:** The API Username or Password fields are empty for the active mode (sandbox or live).

**Solution:**

1. Go to **J2Commerce** -> **Payments** -> **Payment Methods** -> **Klarna**.
2. Check whether **Sandbox Mode** is on or off.
3. Fill in the corresponding credential fields — **Sandbox API Username** and **Sandbox API Password** for sandbox mode, or **API Username** and **API Password** for live mode.
4. Click **Save**.

### Klarna Not Showing for Certain Customers

**Cause:** A **Geozone Restriction**, **Minimum Subtotal**, or **Maximum Subtotal** rule is filtering Klarna out for those customers.

**Solution:**

1. Go to the plugin settings and review the **Geozone Restriction** field — if set, confirm the customer's shipping address falls within that geozone.
2. Check the **Minimum Subtotal** and **Maximum Subtotal** values against the customer's cart total.
3. Also confirm that Klarna's own eligibility rules are not blocking the shopper — for example, Klarna may not be available for certain currencies or order amounts based on your merchant agreement.

### Sandbox Warning Appears on Live Store

**Cause:** **Sandbox Mode** is still enabled after you went live.

**Solution:**

1. Go to **J2Commerce** -> **Payments** -> **Payment Methods** -> **Klarna**.
2. Set **Sandbox Mode** to **No**.
3. Confirm the **API Username**, **API Password**, and **Client Identifier** fields (under the live credentials section) are filled in with your live Klarna credentials.
4. Click **Save**.

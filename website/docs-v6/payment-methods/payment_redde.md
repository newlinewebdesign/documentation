# Redde Payment

The Redde Payment plugin lets your J2Commerce store accept Visa, Mastercard, and other major credit and debit cards through your Redde account (Redde is powered by the **Maverick Payments** gateway). Customers can pay without ever leaving your checkout, and you manage captures, refunds, and voids directly from the J2Commerce order screen.

You can collect card details right on your checkout page (**Direct** mode) or send shoppers to a secure Redde-hosted payment page (**Hosted Form** mode). Logged-in customers can also save a card for faster checkout next time, and you can turn on 3-D Secure for extra fraud protection.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3.0 +
- Joomla! 6.x
- J2Commerce 6.x
- A Redde / Maverick Payments merchant account
- Your store must be reachable over HTTPS (required for card payments and for the gateway to send webhook notifications)

## Purchase and Download

**Step 1:** Go to our [**J2Commerce** website](https://www.j2commerce.com/) **->** **Payment Methods**

**Step 2:** Locate the **Redde** payment plugin **->** click **View Details** **->** **Add to cart -> Checkout**.

**Step 3:** Go to **My Downloads** under your profile button at the top right corner and search for the plugin. Click **Available Versions -> View Files -> Download Now**

## Install the Plugin

You can install the **Redde** plugin using the Joomla installer. The following steps help you with a successful installation.

In the Joomla admin, go to **System -> Install -> Extensions**

Upload the plugin ZIP file or use the **Install from URL** option.

## Enable the Plugin

Once installed, you need to enable the plugin. There are **two** ways to reach it.

**Option A:** Go to the **J2Commerce** icon at the top right corner **-> Payments**

**Option B:** Go to **Components** on the left sidebar **-> J2Commerce -> Payments**

Look for **Redde**, click the **X**, and it will turn into a green checkmark. It is now enabled and ready for setup.

## Get Your Redde Credentials

Before you configure the plugin, log in to your **Redde Dashboard** and collect the following. You will find separate values for **Sandbox** (testing) and **Live** (real payments).

- **Gateway API Token** — under **Developers**. This authorizes card transactions (sale, refund, authorize, capture).
- **Terminal ID** — under **Terminals**. This is the *system terminal ID* sent on every transaction. It is **required** — payments will fail without it.
- **Dashboard API Token** — under **Developers**. Used for saved cards and recurring payments.
- **DBA ID** — under **Merchant**. Used together with the Dashboard token for saved cards.
- **Webhook Signature Secret** — the SHA-512 signing secret set on your webhook endpoint. Used to verify that notifications genuinely come from Redde.

:::info

The **Terminal ID**, **DBA ID**, and **merchant ID** are different values. Be sure to copy the **Terminal ID** exactly as shown in the Dashboard.

:::

## Configure the Plugin

Click the **Redde** title next to the green checkmark to open the settings.

:::tip

Click the **Toggle Inline Help** button in the toolbar and the plugin will show a description below each field as you configure it.

:::

### Display Name and Image

- **Display Name** — the label customers see at checkout (default: *Credit/Debit Card*).
- **Display Image** — an optional logo shown next to the payment option.

### Environment

- **Environment** — choose **Sandbox (Testing)** while you set things up, then switch to **Live (Production)** to take real payments. The plugin shows the matching credential fields depending on which environment you pick.

:::info

In Sandbox mode no real money is taken, and the plugin displays a reminder that you are in test mode.

:::

### Credentials

Enter the tokens you collected from your Redde Dashboard:

- **Gateway API Token**
- **Terminal ID** (required)
- **DBA ID**
- **Dashboard API Token**
- **Webhook Signature Secret**

### Webhook URL

- **Webhook URL** — the plugin displays the address you must paste into your Redde Dashboard webhook settings. This lets Redde notify your store when a payment is confirmed. Click **Copy** to copy it.

:::info

If the Webhook URL shows a local address (such as `localhost`), the gateway cannot reach it. Use your public store URL, or a tunnel such as **ngrok**, when testing.

:::

### Integration Method

- **Integration Method** — choose how card details are collected:
  - **Direct (On-site Card Fields)** — customers type their card on your checkout page. This enables the **Saved Cards** and **3-D Secure** options below.
  - **Hosted Form (Redirect)** — customers are sent to a secure Redde-hosted page to pay, then returned to your store.

### Payment Action

- **Payment Action** — choose what happens when a customer pays:
  - **Authorize and Capture (Sale)** — charges the card immediately.
  - **Authorize Only** — places a hold on the card; you **Capture** it later from the order screen.

### Card Features (Direct mode only)

- **Allow Saved Cards** — let logged-in customers securely save a card for faster checkout next time.
- **Enable 3-D Secure** — turn on 3-D Secure 2 authentication for extra fraud protection. Your Redde terminal must have 3-D Secure enabled for this to work.

### Order Status Mapping

- **Order Status** — the status applied after a successful payment.
- **Authorized Order Status** — (shown when Payment Action is *Authorize Only*) the status applied when a payment is authorized but not yet captured.
- **Change Status on Refund / Refunded Order Status** — optionally move the order to a chosen status when you issue a refund.
- **Change Status on Void / Voided Order Status** — optionally move the order to a chosen status when you void a payment.

### Surcharge (optional)

Add a fee for paying by card:

- **Surcharge Name** — the label shown on the order.
- **Surcharge Percent** — a percentage of the order total.
- **Surcharge Fixed** — a flat amount.
- **Surcharge Tax Class** — the tax profile applied to the surcharge.

### Availability Rules (optional)

Control when Redde is offered at checkout:

- **Geozone Restriction** — show Redde only to customers in a chosen geographic zone.
- **Minimum / Maximum Subtotal** — show Redde only when the cart total falls within a range.

### Other Settings

- **Thank You Message** — an optional article shown to the customer after a successful payment.
- **Debug Logging** — log gateway requests and responses (with sensitive data masked) to the Joomla log to help troubleshoot. **Turn this off in production.**

When you are done, click **Save & Close**.

## How It Works

When a customer reaches checkout:

1. Redde appears as a payment option (subject to your geozone and subtotal rules).
2. In **Direct** mode the customer enters their card on your page; in **Hosted Form** mode they are redirected to Redde to pay.
3. If **3-D Secure** is enabled, the customer may be asked to confirm the payment with their bank.
4. The gateway charges (or authorizes) the card and returns the result.
5. Redde sends a signed webhook notification, which the plugin verifies and uses to confirm the order.
6. The order status is updated according to your **Order Status Mapping** settings.

:::info

Redde processes in US Dollars. If your store sells in another currency, J2Commerce converts the order total to the gateway amount automatically — the customer is still shown your store currency.

:::

## Managing Payments from the Order

Open any Redde order in **J2Commerce -> Orders** and use the buttons in the order view:

- **Capture** — collect a payment that was placed on hold using **Authorize Only**.
- **Void** — cancel a payment before it settles. This cannot be undone.
- **Refund** — return money to the customer. Enter an amount for a partial refund, or leave it for the full amount.

## Saved Cards

When **Allow Saved Cards** is enabled (Direct mode), logged-in customers can tick **Save this card for future purchases** at checkout. On their next order they can choose **Use a saved card** instead of re-entering the details, or **Use a new card**. Card details are stored securely in the gateway's vault — never on your site.

## Tips

- **Test in Sandbox first** — complete a full test order in Sandbox mode before switching to Live.
- **Double-check the Terminal ID** — a missing or wrong Terminal ID is the most common cause of failed payments.
- **Set up the webhook early** — paste the Webhook URL into your Redde Dashboard so order confirmations arrive reliably.
- **Use Authorize Only for pre-orders** — place a hold now and capture when you ship.
- **Disable Debug Logging in production** — leave it on only while troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting

### Redde Does Not Appear at Checkout

**Cause:** The plugin is disabled, or an availability rule is excluding the cart.

**Solution:**

1. Go to **J2Commerce -> Payments** and confirm **Redde** shows a green checkmark (enabled).
2. Check the **Geozone Restriction** and **Minimum / Maximum Subtotal** settings — the current cart may fall outside them.
3. Confirm the customer's address falls inside the selected geozone.

### "Gateway token is not configured" Message

**Cause:** The Gateway API Token for the selected environment is empty.

**Solution:**

1. Open the plugin settings and confirm you are on the correct **Environment** (Sandbox vs Live).
2. Paste the matching **Gateway API Token** from your Redde Dashboard and save.

### Payments Are Declined or Fail

**Cause:** Missing Terminal ID, wrong environment, or a card issue.

**Solution:**

1. Confirm the **Terminal ID** is entered exactly as shown in your Dashboard (required on every transaction).
2. Make sure the **Environment** matches your credentials (Sandbox tokens only work in Sandbox).
3. Ask the customer to verify their card details or try a different card.
4. Turn on **Debug Logging** temporarily and review the Joomla log for the gateway's response.

### Orders Stay Unpaid After a Successful Payment

**Cause:** Redde cannot reach your webhook URL.

**Solution:**

1. In the plugin settings, copy the **Webhook URL** and confirm it is set in your Redde Dashboard.
2. Make sure the URL is publicly reachable over HTTPS (not a local address).
3. Confirm the **Webhook Signature Secret** in the plugin matches the one in your Dashboard.

### 3-D Secure Is Not Triggering

**Cause:** 3-D Secure is off, or it is not enabled on your terminal.

**Solution:**

1. Set **Enable 3-D Secure** to **Yes** in the plugin (Direct mode only).
2. Confirm 3-D Secure is enabled for your terminal in the Redde Dashboard.

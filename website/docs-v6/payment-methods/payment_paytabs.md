# PayTabs Payment

PayTabs is a payment gateway built for merchants in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. It lets your customers pay by credit or debit card — including regional cards like Mada (Saudi Arabia) and Meeza (Egypt) — without leaving your store. New card payments are handled on a secure PayTabs-hosted page, while returning customers who have saved their card can pay entirely on-site without being redirected anywhere.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3.0 or higher
- Joomla! 6.x
- J2Commerce 6.x
- An active PayTabs merchant account

## Purchase and Download

This plugin is a separate add-on available from the [J2Commerce website](https://www.j2commerce.com). It is not included with the core J2Commerce component.

**Step 1:** Go to [www.j2commerce.com](https://www.j2commerce.com) and find the **PayTabs Payment** plugin.

**Step 2:** Click **View Details**, add it to your cart, and complete checkout.

**Step 3:** Go to **My Downloads** under your profile at the top right. Click **Available Versions** -> **View Files** -> **Download Now**.

## Before You Start

You need a PayTabs merchant account. Sign up at [www.paytabs.com](https://www.paytabs.com) and then locate three credentials inside the PayTabs merchant portal:

| Credential | Where to find it | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Profile ID** | PayTabs portal -> Account Settings | A short number that identifies your merchant profile |
| **Server Key** | PayTabs portal -> Account Settings -> Security | A long secret key used by your server to communicate securely with PayTabs — never share this publicly |
| **Client Key** | PayTabs portal -> Account Settings -> Security | A key used by the payment form in the browser to load the card fields |

:::tip

PayTabs provides separate test credentials so you can process dummy payments without real money moving. Log into the PayTabs sandbox portal to find your test Profile ID, Server Key, and Client Key.

:::

## Install the Plugin

1. Go to **System** -> **Install** -> **Extensions** in the Joomla admin panel.
2. Upload the `payment_paytabs.zip` file you downloaded.
3. The plugin installs automatically.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Joomla extension installer upload screen with the PayTabs zip ready to upload -->

## Enable the Plugin

After installation, the plugin needs to be enabled before it appears at checkout.

1. Go to **J2Commerce** -> **Payments** -> **Payment Methods**.
2. Find **PayTabs Payment** in the list.
3. Click the toggle in the **Enabled** column to turn it on (it should show green).

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Payment Methods list with PayTabs showing a green enabled toggle -->

## Configure the Plugin

Click the **PayTabs Payment** name to open the settings screen.

:::tip

Click the **Toggle Inline Help** button in the toolbar and a description will appear below each field as you configure it.

:::

<!-- SCREENSHOT: PayTabs plugin settings screen showing all fields -->

### Display Settings

| Field | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Display Name** | The payment option name shown to customers at checkout (e.g., "Credit Card" or "Pay by Card") | Credit Card |
| **Display Image** | Upload a logo or card icons to show next to the payment option | — |

### Transaction Type

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Auth & Capture** | Charges the customer's card immediately when they place the order. This is the standard choice for most stores. |
| **Auth Only** | Reserves the funds but does not charge the card. You then capture (collect) the payment manually from the admin order page when you are ready to ship. |

### Region

Select the region that matches your PayTabs merchant account location. The region controls which PayTabs server handles your payments. Choose the option that matches your country:

- Saudi Arabia
- UAE (United Arab Emirates)
- Egypt
- Oman
- Jordan
- Iraq
- Kuwait
- Qatar
- Morocco
- Bahrain
- Global

:::caution

Selecting the wrong region will cause all payments to fail. Match this setting to the country where your PayTabs account is registered.

:::

### Test Mode

Enable **Test Mode** to use your sandbox credentials and process dummy payments without charging any real cards. Set this to **No** when you are ready to go live.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Sandbox toggle switch set to Yes -->

### Credentials

When **Test Mode** is off, fill in your **live** credentials. When **Test Mode** is on, fill in your **test** credentials. Both sets of fields appear separately so you can switch between them easily.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Profile ID** | Your numeric merchant profile identifier from the PayTabs portal |
| **Server Key** | Your secret server key — paste it in and keep it confidential |
| **Client Key** | Your browser-side key used to load the secure card input fields |

:::warning

Never share your **Server Key** publicly or paste it into any frontend code. It must stay on the server side only.

:::

### Accepted Card Types

Choose which card networks to accept. You can select multiple options:

- Visa
- Mastercard
- American Express
- **Mada** — Saudi Arabia's national debit card scheme
- **Meeza** — Egypt's national card scheme

### Allow Saved Cards

When enabled, logged-in customers can tick a box at checkout to save their card for future orders. On their next purchase they can simply select the saved card instead of entering their details again. Saved cards are also used for automatic subscription renewal payments — see [Subscriptions & Recurring Billing](#subscriptions--recurring-billing) below for everything you need to set up before renewals can work.

Set this to **No** if you prefer customers to always enter their card details fresh each time.

### Layout (Subtemplate)

If your site uses the UIkit template framework, choose **UIkit** from the layout dropdown. Otherwise leave this on the default Bootstrap 5 layout.

### Order Statuses

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Successful Payment Status** | The order status applied when a payment is confirmed. "Confirmed" is the typical choice. |
| **Change Order Status on Void** | When enabled, voiding a transaction automatically moves the order to a status you choose. |
| **Void Order Status** | The order status to set after a successful void. Only visible when the option above is enabled. |
| **Change Order Status on Refund** | When enabled, processing a refund automatically moves the order to a status you choose. |
| **Refund Order Status** | The order status to set after a successful refund. Only visible when the option above is enabled. |

### Surcharge / Payment Fee

If PayTabs charges you a processing fee and you want to pass part or all of it on to customers, fill in these fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Surcharge Name** | The label shown to customers (e.g., "Card processing fee") |
| **Surcharge %** | A percentage of the order subtotal added as a fee (e.g., `2.5` for 2.5%) |
| **Surcharge Fixed Amount** | A flat fee added to every order (e.g., `0.50` for $0.50) |
| **Surcharge Tax Class** | Select a tax profile if the fee itself needs to be taxed |

Leave all three blank if you do not want to add a fee.

### Availability Restrictions

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Geozone Restriction** | Only show this payment method to customers whose billing address falls inside a specific geozone. Leave blank to show it to everyone. |
| **Minimum Order Subtotal** | Hide this payment method if the order subtotal is below this amount. Leave blank for no minimum. |
| **Maximum Order Subtotal** | Hide this payment method if the order subtotal is above this amount. Leave blank for no maximum. |

### Thank You Message

Use the **Thank You Article** field to select a Joomla article that appears on the order confirmation page after a successful payment. This is a good place for delivery instructions, next-step information, or a personal note.

### Custom Messages

These optional text fields let you add HTML messages at specific moments during checkout:

| Field | When it appears |
|---|---|
| **On Selection** | When the customer chooses PayTabs as their payment method |
| **On Before Payment** | Inside the payment form area, above the card input |
| **On After Payment** | On the order confirmation page after a successful payment |
| **On Error Payment** | When a payment attempt fails |
| **On Cancel Payment** | When the customer cancels the payment process |

### Debug Mode

Enable **Debug Mode** to log all communication between J2Commerce and PayTabs. This is helpful when diagnosing configuration issues. Logs are written to the Joomla system log file. Disable this on a live store once everything is working.

## What the Customer Sees

When a customer reaches checkout and selects the PayTabs payment option:

1. The checkout page shows a **Place Order** button with a note that they will be redirected to PayTabs' secure page.
2. If the customer has previously saved a card, their saved cards appear as radio button options. They can choose a saved card or select **Use a new card**.
3. When paying with a saved card, the payment happens on-site — no redirect.
4. When paying with a new card, clicking **Place Order** redirects the customer to the PayTabs-hosted payment page where they enter their card details in a PCI-compliant environment.
5. After entering their details on the PayTabs page, the customer is returned to your store and lands on the order confirmation page.
6. If the customer ticks **Save this card for future purchases**, the card is stored for their account and available on their next visit.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Checkout payment step showing PayTabs option selected with saved card radio buttons and Place Order button -->

:::note

PayTabs handles card security on their end. Your store never receives or stores raw card numbers, which means your store qualifies for the simplest level of PCI compliance (SAQ A).

## Managing Payments from the Order Screen

Once a customer has paid, additional actions are available from the **J2Commerce** -> **Sales** -> **Orders** -> open the order screen.

### Void a Transaction

If you chose **Auth Only** as the transaction type, the customer's card was reserved but not charged. You can **Void** the reservation from the order screen. This releases the funds back to the customer and is typically used when you cannot fulfill the order.

### Refund a Payment

From the order screen you can issue a **full refund** (the entire order amount) or a **partial refund** (a specific amount you enter). The money is returned to the customer's original card. J2Commerce records the refund in the order history automatically.

### Charge a Stored Card (Admin)

If a customer has saved cards on file and an order has not yet been paid, you can charge one of their saved cards directly from the order screen without the customer needing to log in and go through checkout again. This is useful for phone orders or subscription renewals that need manual intervention.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Admin order page showing Void, Refund, and Charge Stored Card action buttons -->

## Subscriptions & Recurring Billing

PayTabs works with the **J2Commerce Memberships & Subscriptions** app to automatically rebill customers on each renewal cycle. When a customer first buys a subscription or membership, their card is tokenized (saved) during checkout. Every time a renewal comes due, the J2Commerce cron job charges that saved token directly — a merchant-initiated transaction that happens in the background with no redirect and no action required from the customer.

### Prerequisites

Three things must be in place before automatic renewals can fire:

1. **Allow Saved Cards must be On.** A reusable token must exist for the customer. If there is no saved card on file for the subscriber, the renewal cannot be charged automatically.
2. **The J2Commerce scheduled task must be running.** The cron job that triggers renewals on their due date must be active. Go to **System** -> **Scheduled Tasks** and confirm the J2Commerce renewal task is enabled and has a recent last-run time.
3. **Recurring billing must be enabled on your PayTabs profile** — see the warning below. This is the step most merchants overlook.

:::caution Recurring billing must be enabled on your PayTabs profile

Recurring (token-based, server-to-server) charging is **not a self-service toggle** in the PayTabs merchant dashboard. It must be enabled on your specific merchant profile by PayTabs' team.

**What to do:**

Email **support@paytabs.com** (or contact your PayTabs account manager directly) and request that recurring / MIT (merchant-initiated transaction) charging be enabled. Include:

- Your **Profile ID** (the numeric identifier from PayTabs portal -> Account Settings)
- Your business need, for example: "I am using J2Commerce to sell subscription memberships and need recurring charges enabled so renewal payments can be processed automatically against saved customer card tokens."

PayTabs will review your request and enable the feature on that profile. Until they do, every automatic renewal attempt will fail.

:::

### How to tell if recurring billing is not yet enabled

If PayTabs has not yet enabled recurring on your profile, renewal attempts fail silently from the customer's perspective. In your store admin, open **J2Commerce** -> **Apps** -> **Memberships & Subscriptions** and review the renewal log for that subscriber. You will see a PayTabs error response with the message:

> **Method/Class/Currency combination not supported** (response code 112)

The renewal order will be created but remain in a **New** (unpaid) status, and the subscription record will be marked as failed or past-due. The card itself is fine — the issue is purely the profile-level restriction on the PayTabs side.

Once PayTabs enables recurring on your profile, the next scheduled renewal attempt will go through normally. You do not need to change any setting in J2Commerce.

## Tips

- **Start in Test Mode** — Configure your test credentials first, process a few dummy payments to confirm everything works, then switch to live credentials.
- **Match the region to your account** — This is the most common configuration mistake. Double-check that the region you select matches the country where your PayTabs account is registered.
- **Enable saved cards for subscription stores** — If you sell subscription products, saved cards enable automatic renewal payments without asking the customer to re-enter their details each cycle.
- **Use the surcharge to recover fees** — PayTabs charges a processing fee per transaction. The surcharge fields let you offset this cost transparently.
- **Check the dashboard warning** — When Test Mode is on, a warning banner appears on the J2Commerce dashboard to remind you that real payments are not being processed.

## Troubleshooting

### Payments Fail Immediately After Setup

**Cause:** Credentials are missing or the wrong region is selected.

**Solution:**

1. Go to **J2Commerce** -> **Payments** -> **Payment Methods** -> open **PayTabs Payment**.
2. Confirm the **Region** matches your PayTabs account country.
3. Confirm all three credentials (Profile ID, Server Key, Client Key) are pasted in correctly with no leading or trailing spaces.
4. Enable **Debug Mode**, attempt a test payment, then check the Joomla log file (go to **System** -> **System Information** -> **Directory Permissions** to find the log path).

### The PayTabs Option Does Not Appear at Checkout

**Cause:** The plugin is disabled, the order subtotal is outside the configured limits, or the customer's billing address is outside the configured geozone.

**Solution:**

1. Go to **J2Commerce** -> **Payments** -> **Payment Methods** and confirm the PayTabs row shows a green enabled status.
2. Check **Minimum Order Subtotal** and **Maximum Order Subtotal** — if set, verify the current cart total falls within the range.
3. Check **Geozone Restriction** — if set, verify the customer's billing country is inside that geozone.

### Customer Is Redirected to PayTabs But Payment Does Not Confirm Back

**Cause:** PayTabs uses a server-to-server notification (IPN — Instant Payment Notification) to tell J2Commerce the payment succeeded. If your server is not publicly reachable (e.g., a local development site), the notification cannot arrive.

**Solution:** Test on a publicly accessible server or use a tunnelling tool to expose your local environment. The PayTabs IPN URL is your store URL — make sure it is reachable from the internet.

### "Payment gateway is not configured" Error at Checkout

**Cause:** One or more of the three required credentials (Profile ID, Server Key, Client Key) is empty.

**Solution:** Open the plugin settings and confirm all three credential fields are filled in for the currently active mode (live or test).

### Saved Cards Do Not Appear at Checkout

**Cause:** The customer is not logged in, or **Allow Saved Cards** is disabled in the plugin settings.

**Solution:**

1. Confirm the customer is logged into their account (guests cannot use saved cards).
2. Open the plugin settings and check that **Allow Saved Cards** is set to **Yes**.

### A Refund or Void Fails

**Cause:** Voids can only be performed on authorized (uncaptured) transactions. Refunds can only be performed on captured (charged) transactions. Attempting the wrong action for the transaction state will fail.

**Solution:** Check the order history tab to confirm the original transaction status, then use the correct action: **Void** for an uncaptured auth, **Refund** for a completed charge.

# Minimum Order Restriction

The Minimum Order Restriction app lets you set rules that must be satisfied before a customer can proceed from the cart to checkout. When any rule is violated, the customer is redirected back to the cart with a plain-English warning message telling them exactly what needs to change. You can enforce a price floor, quantity limits, pack-size requirements, and category-specific spending thresholds — all from a single plugin.

This plugin is a separate add-on available from the [J2Commerce Extensions Store](https://www.j2commerce.com). It is not included with the core J2Commerce component.

## Installation

1. Purchase and download the `plg_j2commerce_app_minimumorder.zip` package from the J2Commerce website.
2. Go to **System** -> **Install** -> **Extensions** in the Joomla administrator.
3. Upload the zip file using the **Upload Package File** tab.
4. The plugin installs automatically. You will see the message: "Plugin 'Minimum Order Restriction' installed. Enable it via the Joomla Plugin Manager."
5. Go to **System** -> **Manage** -> **Plugins**.
6. Search for **Minimum Order Restriction**.
7. Click the status icon to enable it (it should turn green).

## Overview of the Three Restriction Modes

The plugin has three independently enabled restriction modes. Each mode has its own on/off toggle, so you can use one, two, or all three at the same time.

| Mode | What it checks |
|------|----------------|
| **Price-Based** | Cart subtotal or order total versus a minimum amount |
| **Quantity-Based** | Total cart quantity or per-item quantity versus minimum/maximum values |
| **Category-Based** | Combined value of items from specific Joomla content categories |

Checks run in order: price first, then quantity, then category. The customer is redirected on the first failure — they will not see multiple errors at once.

---

## How Enforcement Works

The plugin enforces your rules in two places, so customers get early feedback and the limits cannot be bypassed.

### At the cart drawer

When a shopper opens the cart drawer (the slide-out cart), the plugin checks the current cart against your rules. If any rule is violated, a warning appears and the **Checkout** button is disabled until the cart satisfies every restriction. This gives customers immediate, on-page feedback before they try to continue.

### At checkout

When a shopper proceeds to checkout, the plugin re-checks every rule on the server. If a rule is not met, the shopper is redirected back to the cart page with a plain-English warning describing exactly what needs to change. This server-side check is the definitive enforcement — even if a shopper bypasses the front-end warning (for example with JavaScript disabled), the checkout redirect still fires.

### Warning messages shoppers see

The exact message depends on which rule was violated:

- "Minimum order should be [amount] or above."
- "Total cart quantity should be [number] or above."
- "Total cart quantity should be [number] or below."
- "You have reached the minimum restriction for [product name] (minimum of [number])."
- "You have reached the maximum restriction for [product name] (maximum of [number])."
- "[Product name] must be ordered in multiples of [number]."
- "Total cart quantity must be a multiple of [number]."
- "Minimum category order value should be [amount] or above."

## Price-Based Restriction

This mode blocks checkout when the cart value is too low.

### Step 1: Enable price-based restriction

In the plugin's **Price-Based Settings** tab, set **Enable Price-Based Restriction** to **Yes**.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Price-Based Settings tab with Enable Price-Based Restriction toggled to Yes -->

### Step 2: Choose what to measure

Use the **Calculation Type** dropdown to pick what the minimum applies to:

| Option | What it uses |
|--------|-------------|
| **Subtotal** | The cart subtotal before taxes, shipping, and discounts |
| **Total** | The final order total (after taxes, shipping, and discounts) |

If you choose **Total**, an extra field appears: **Include Discount in Order Total?**

| Option | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| **Include Discount** (default) | The minimum is compared against the total after coupons |
| **Exclude Discount** | The minimum is compared against the total before coupons are subtracted |

Use **Exclude Discount** if you want the minimum to apply to the full product value, not after coupon savings.

### Step 3: Set the minimum amount

Enter the amount in **Minimum Subtotal / Total**. Use the same currency your store displays. For example, enter `50` for a $50 minimum.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Price-Based Settings tab showing Calculation Type set to Subtotal and Minimum Subtotal / Total field set to 50 -->

### Common use cases

- **Wholesale store:** Set a $100 minimum subtotal so that small retail-quantity orders are automatically blocked.
- **Free shipping threshold enforcement:** Pair a minimum total with your free shipping rule — if the total is under the free shipping threshold, customers are nudged to add more items before proceeding.

## Quantity-Based Restriction

This mode blocks checkout based on how many units are in the cart.

### Step 1: Enable quantity-based restriction

In the **Quantity-Based Settings** tab, set **Enable Quantity-Based Restriction** to **Yes**.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Quantity-Based Settings tab with the enable toggle set to Yes and all fields visible -->

### Step 2: Choose what the limits apply to

Use **Quantity Restriction Applies To** to decide the scope:

| Option | What it checks |
|--------|----------------|
| **Total Cart Quantity** | The combined quantity across all line items in the cart |
| **Per-Item Quantity** | The quantity of each individual line item |

### Step 3: Set minimum and maximum quantities

- **Minimum Quantity** — the smallest allowed quantity. Leave at `0` to skip the minimum check.
- **Maximum Quantity** — the largest allowed quantity. Leave at `0` to skip the maximum check.

### Step 4: Pack-size enforcement (optional)

Set **Quantity Must Be a Multiple of Minimum?** to **Yes** if you sell in packs. When enabled, the quantity must be an exact multiple of the minimum. For example, with minimum set to `6`, allowed quantities are 6, 12, 18, 24, and so on. Any other quantity triggers the warning and redirects to cart.

This applies to whichever scope you chose in Step 2 — cart total quantity or per-item quantity.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Quantity-Based Settings showing Minimum Quantity 6, Maximum Quantity 0, Quantity Must Be a Multiple of Minimum set to Yes -->

### Common use cases

- **Minimum purchase quantity of 2:** Set scope to **Total Cart Quantity**, minimum to `2`, maximum to `0`.
- **Bulk packs only:** Set scope to **Per-Item Quantity**, minimum to `6`, maximum to `0`, and enable the multiple requirement.
- **Event ticket cap:** Set scope to **Total Cart Quantity**, minimum to `1`, maximum to `10` to limit large bulk purchases at checkout.

## Category-Based Restriction

This mode blocks checkout when items from specific Joomla content categories do not reach a minimum combined value. It is useful for stores that carry products across multiple categories and want to require a minimum spend within a particular product range.

### Step 1: Select the categories

In the **Category-Based Settings** tab, click the **Restricted Categories** field and choose one or more Joomla content categories. The check automatically includes products from any descendant categories of those you select — you do not need to list child categories individually.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Category-Based Settings tab with the Restricted Categories picker open showing a category tree -->

### Step 2: Set the minimum value

Enter the amount in **Minimum Category Order Value**. The plugin adds up the line totals (quantity multiplied by unit price) for every item whose article belongs to the selected categories. If that combined value is below the minimum, checkout is blocked.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Category-Based Settings tab with Minimum Category Order Value set to 75 -->

### How the value is calculated

- Only items from `com_content` (Joomla articles) are counted.
- The unit price used is the base item price plus any option add-ons.
- If the cart contains no items from the restricted categories at all, the check is skipped — the customer is not blocked.
- Descendant categories are matched by walking up the category tree up to 20 levels deep.

### Common use case

A store sells general merchandise and specialty tools. They want customers to spend at least $50 on specialty tools before checkout. Configure the Specialty Tools category here and set the minimum to `50`. Orders with no specialty tool items proceed normally; orders with specialty tools totalling under $50 are blocked.

## Per-Product Quantity Override

Any individual product can opt into its own minimum and maximum quantity rules. When a product uses its own limits, it is also exempt from the global per-item maximum set in the Quantity-Based Settings tab.

### Where to find these fields

1. Go to **J2Commerce** -> **Catalog** -> **Products**.
2. Open the product you want to configure.
3. Click the **Apps** tab in the product editor.
4. Find the **Quantity Restriction** section provided by the Minimum Order Restriction plugin.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Product editor Apps tab showing the Quantity Restriction section with three fields -->

### Available fields

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Enable Per-Product Quantity Restriction** | Activates this product's own limits. Must be set to **Yes** for the fields below to take effect. | No |
| **Product Minimum Quantity** | Minimum units of this product required in the cart at checkout. Set to `0` to skip. | 0 |
| **Product Maximum Quantity** | Maximum units of this product allowed in the cart at checkout. Set to `0` to skip. | 0 |

### When to use per-product overrides

- A product is sold individually and cannot be purchased in bulk — set maximum to `1`.
- A component or part requires purchasing at least 2 units — set minimum to `2`.
- A limited-edition item should not override general store limits but needs its own cap — enable the override and set only the maximum.

The per-product check runs as part of the quantity restriction phase. If the global quantity restriction is disabled in the plugin settings, per-product overrides are still enforced.

## What Changed from J2Store

If you used Minimum Order Restriction with J2Store v4, here is what is different in J2Commerce 6:

- **No legacy Admin Apps view.** The plugin no longer adds a tab to the old J2Store backend apps area. Configuration is done entirely through the standard Joomla Plugin Manager or the **J2Commerce** -> **Apps** screen.
- **XML-based product fields.** Per-product minimum/maximum fields are rendered via Joomla's form API. There is no jQuery dependency for displaying these fields in the product editor.
- **Parameterised SQL.** All database queries use bound parameters — no raw string concatenation.
- **Per-product max exemption works correctly.** In J2Store v4, enabling a per-product override did not always exempt the product from the global per-item maximum. In J2Commerce 6, enabling **Enable Per-Product Quantity Restriction** on any product correctly skips the global per-item maximum check for that product, even when the product itself has no maximum set.

## Troubleshooting

### Customers can still check out below the minimum amount

**Possible cause:** The plugin is installed but not enabled.

**Solution:**
1. Go to **System** -> **Manage** -> **Plugins**.
2. Search for **Minimum Order Restriction**.
3. Confirm the status is green (enabled).
4. Open the plugin and check that **Enable Price-Based Restriction** is set to **Yes** and that **Minimum Subtotal / Total** is greater than `0`.

### The amount check passes but the cart total looks correct

**Possible cause:** You have **Calculation Type** set to **Total** and the order total includes taxes or shipping that push it above the threshold, even though the product subtotal is lower.

**Solution:** Switch **Calculation Type** to **Subtotal** if you want the check to run against product prices only, before taxes and shipping are added.

Alternatively, if you are using the **Total** calculation and coupons apply, check the **Include Discount in Order Total?** setting. With **Include Discount** active, a coupon can reduce the total below the threshold. Switch to **Exclude Discount** if you do not want coupons to affect this check.

### The quantity multiple check is not triggering

**Possible cause:** **Quantity Must Be a Multiple of Minimum?** is set to **Yes**, but **Minimum Quantity** is `0`.

**Solution:** Enter a value greater than `0` in **Minimum Quantity**. The multiple check requires a non-zero minimum to divide by.

### Category restriction never blocks checkout

**Possible cause 1:** The products in the cart do not use Joomla articles as their source. The category restriction only counts items sourced from `com_content`.

**Possible cause 2:** No categories are selected in the **Restricted Categories** field, or the minimum value is `0`.

**Solution:** Open the plugin, go to **Category-Based Settings**, confirm that at least one category is selected and that **Minimum Category Order Value** is greater than `0`.

### Finding the debug log

When **Debug Mode** is set to **Yes**, the plugin writes a log entry every time it blocks a checkout. The log file is located at:

```
[joomla-root]/administrator/logs/plg_j2commerce_app_minimumorder.php
```

Each entry includes the reason the checkout was blocked. Review this file if a restriction appears to be firing incorrectly or not firing at all. Disable Debug Mode in production once you have confirmed the rules are working correctly.

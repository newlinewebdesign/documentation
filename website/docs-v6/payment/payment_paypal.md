# PayPal Payment

The PayPal plugin lets your customers pay using PayPal's Smart Payment Buttons — a modern, secure checkout experience that supports PayPal accounts, credit cards, and other payment methods PayPal offers in your customers' region.

The plugin uses PayPal's REST API v2, so no redirects are needed. Customers complete payment directly on your checkout page without leaving your site. Refunds, webhook notifications, and sandbox testing are all built in.

## Prerequisites

- J2Commerce installed and active on your Joomla site
- A PayPal Business account (see the setup steps below)
- REST API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) from the PayPal Developer Dashboard

---

## Step 1: Set Up a PayPal Business Account

If you already have a PayPal Business account and REST API credentials, skip ahead to [Installation & Enabling](#installation--enabling).

### Create a PayPal Business Account

1. Go to [paypal.com](https://www.paypal.com) and click **Sign Up**.
2. Choose **Business Account** and click **Next**.
3. Enter your email address and create a password.
4. Fill in your business details — business name, address, and phone number.
5. Verify your email address when PayPal sends you a confirmation email.
6. Complete the identity verification steps PayPal requires (this varies by country).

### Get Your REST API Credentials

After your account is active:

1. Go to [developer.paypal.com](https://developer.paypal.com) and log in with your PayPal Business account.
2. Click **Apps & Credentials** in the top navigation.
3. Make sure you are on the **Live** tab (not Sandbox).
4. Click **Create App**.
5. Give the app a name — for example, "My Store".
6. Click **Create App** to confirm.
7. On the next page you will see your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy both and keep them somewhere safe.

**Sandbox credentials** (for testing): Click the **Sandbox** tab on the same Apps & Credentials page. Create a separate sandbox app or use the default one. Copy the Sandbox Client ID and Sandbox Client Secret separately.

---

## Installation & Enabling

The PayPal plugin ships with J2Commerce 6 and is available immediately after installation. Because it requires your merchant credentials before it can process payments, it is not enabled automatically during installation.

To enable it:

1. Go to **J2Commerce** -> **Payments** -> **Payment Methods**.
2. Find **PayPal** in the list.
3. Click the toggle in the **Enabled** column to enable the plugin, or click the plugin name to open its settings first.

## Configuration

Go to **J2Commerce** -> **Payments** -> **Payment Methods** and click **PayPal** to open the settings.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: PayPal plugin configuration form in J2Commerce admin -->

### Display Settings

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Display Name** | The label shown to customers at checkout | `PayPal` |
| **Display Image** | Optional logo or image shown next to the payment option at checkout | _(none)_ |

### Sandbox Mode

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Use PayPal Sandbox** | Switch this on to use PayPal's test environment. No real money is processed. | No |

Turn sandbox mode **on** while you are setting up and testing. Turn it **off** before you go live.

When sandbox mode is active, a warning banner appears on the J2Commerce dashboard so you cannot accidentally forget.

### Live API Credentials

These are used when **Use PayPal Sandbox** is set to **No**.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Client ID** | Your live REST API Client ID from [developer.paypal.com](https://developer.paypal.com) |
| **Client Secret** | Your live REST API Client Secret |

### Sandbox API Credentials

These are used when **Use PayPal Sandbox** is set to **Yes**.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Sandbox Client ID** | Your sandbox REST API Client ID |
| **Sandbox Client Secret** | Your sandbox REST API Client Secret |

### Webhooks (Optional but Recommended)

Webhooks allow PayPal to notify your store automatically when payment events occur — for example, when a payment completes, is refunded, or is disputed. Without webhooks, order status updates only happen when the customer completes checkout on your page.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Webhook ID** | The Webhook ID from your live PayPal app in the developer dashboard |
| **Sandbox Webhook ID** | The Webhook ID from your sandbox PayPal app |

**How to create a webhook in PayPal:**

1. In the PayPal Developer Dashboard, open your app.
2. Scroll down to **Webhooks** and click **Add Webhook**.
3. Enter your webhook URL. The URL format for J2Commerce is: `https://yoursite.com/index.php?option=com_j2commerce&task=checkout.processWebhook&payment_method=payment_paypal`
4. Select the events you want to receive. Recommended events: `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED`, `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.DENIED`, `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.REFUNDED`, `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.REVERSED`, `CUSTOMER.DISPUTE.CREATED`, `CUSTOMER.DISPUTE.RESOLVED`.
5. Click **Save**. Copy the **Webhook ID** shown and paste it into the plugin configuration.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: PayPal webhook creation form -->

### Order Status

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Order Status** | The order status applied after a successful payment capture | `Confirmed` |

Choose the status that fits your workflow. Most stores use **Confirmed** or **Processing** for paid orders.

### Surcharge

Add an optional surcharge to orders paid via PayPal. This is useful if you want to pass on PayPal's processing fee to customers (check your local laws and PayPal's terms before doing this).

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Surcharge Name** | Label shown to customers for the surcharge (e.g., "PayPal Fee") | _(none)_ |
| **Surcharge Percent** | Percentage of the order subtotal added as a surcharge | _(none)_ |
| **Surcharge Fixed** | Fixed amount added as a surcharge | _(none)_ |
| **Surcharge Tax Class** | Tax profile to apply to the surcharge amount | _(none)_ |

You can combine a percentage and a fixed amount — both will be added together.

### Geo-Zone Restriction

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Geo-Zone Restriction** | Limit PayPal availability to customers in a specific geo-zone | _(none — available everywhere)_ |

Leave this empty to show PayPal to all customers regardless of location.

### Order Amount Limits

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Minimum Subtotal** | Hide PayPal if the cart subtotal is below this amount. Leave empty for no minimum. | _(none)_ |
| **Maximum Subtotal** | Hide PayPal if the cart subtotal exceeds this amount. Leave empty or set to `-1` for no maximum. | _(none)_ |

### Thank You Page

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Thank You Article** | Select a Joomla article to display after a successful payment. This is shown on the confirmation page in addition to the standard confirmation message. |

### Custom Messages

These text fields let you customize messages shown to customers at different points in the payment process.

| Field | When it displays |
|-------|-----------------|
| **On Selection** | When the customer selects PayPal as their payment method |
| **On Before Payment** | On the payment page before the customer clicks Pay |
| **On After Payment** | On the confirmation page after a successful payment |
| **On Error Payment** | When a payment error occurs |
| **On Cancel Payment** | When the customer cancels payment and returns to the cart |

### Dashboard Icon

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Show Dashboard Icon** | Show a shortcut icon for PayPal on the J2Commerce dashboard | No |
| **Dashboard Icon Label** | Label for the dashboard icon (only visible when Show Dashboard Icon is Yes) | _(none)_ |

### Subtemplate

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Subtemplate** | Select an alternative layout template for the PayPal payment form, if any are installed | _(default)_ |

### Debug Mode

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Debug Mode** | Write detailed PayPal API activity to `administrator/logs/payment_paypal.php` and the browser console | No |

Enable debug mode only while troubleshooting. Disable it in production — logs can grow large quickly.

## Supported Currencies

PayPal does not support every currency. If your store uses a currency not in this list, PayPal will not be available at checkout.

Supported currencies: AUD, BRL, CAD, CNY, CZK, DKK, EUR, HKD, HUF, INR, ILS, JPY, MYR, MXN, TWD, NZD, NOK, PHP, PLN, GBP, RUB, SGD, SEK, CHF, THB, USD.

---

## Checkout Experience

When a customer selects PayPal at checkout:

1. The PayPal Smart Payment Buttons load on the page.
2. The customer clicks their preferred option — **PayPal**, credit card, or any other method PayPal offers in their region.
3. A PayPal login window (or card form) appears. The customer completes payment.
4. The payment is captured immediately.
5. The customer is returned to your confirmation page.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: PayPal Smart Payment Buttons on the checkout page -->

Payment happens without the customer leaving your site. The PayPal popup or inline experience handles authentication securely.

If the customer clicks **Cancel** in the PayPal window, they are returned to checkout and the cart remains intact. The cancellation message you configured is displayed.

---

## Order Management

Once a customer pays, J2Commerce records the transaction details against the order:

- **Order status** is updated to the status you configured (default: Confirmed).
- **Transaction ID** — the PayPal capture ID — is stored with the order.
- **Order history** is updated with a "Payment received via PayPal" note.

### Refunds

You can issue a refund directly from the order in the J2Commerce admin:

1. Go to **J2Commerce** -> **Orders** and open the order.
2. Click the **Refund** button.
3. Enter the amount to refund (leave blank to refund the full amount).
4. Confirm the refund.

The refund is sent to PayPal via the API. The order status is updated and a note is added to the order history.

### Webhook-Triggered Updates

If webhooks are configured, PayPal can update order statuses automatically for events that happen outside the normal checkout flow:

| PayPal Event | What happens in J2Commerce |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Payment capture completed | Order status updated to the configured "Confirmed" state |
| Payment capture pending | Order status updated to Pending |
| Payment capture denied | Order status updated to Failed |
| Payment refunded | Order status updated to Refunded |
| Payment reversed (chargeback) | Order status updated to Failed, flagged for review in order history |
| Dispute created | Warning logged in the application log |
| Dispute resolved | Resolution logged in the application log |

Webhook events are deduplicated — if PayPal sends the same event twice, it is processed only once.

## Going Live Checklist

Before accepting real payments, confirm the following:

- [ ] **Use PayPal Sandbox** is set to **No**
- [ ] Your live **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are entered
- [ ] The webhook URL is registered in your live PayPal app and the **Webhook ID** is saved
- [ ] You have placed a test order using a real PayPal account with a small amount and then refunded it
- [ ] **Debug Mode** is set to **No**

---

## Troubleshooting

### PayPal buttons do not appear at checkout

**Cause:** The Client ID is missing or incorrect, or the plugin is not enabled.

**Solution:**
1. Go to **J2Commerce** -> **Payments** -> **Payment Methods** and confirm PayPal is enabled.
2. Check that a Client ID (or Sandbox Client ID if in sandbox mode) is entered.
3. Enable **Debug Mode** and check the browser console for error messages.

### "PayPal plugin is not properly configured" message

**Cause:** The Client ID field is empty.

**Solution:** Open the PayPal plugin settings and enter your Client ID and Client Secret.

### Payments go through in PayPal but the order stays Pending

**Cause:** Webhooks are not configured, so J2Commerce does not receive the payment confirmation from PayPal.

**Solution:**
1. Set up a webhook in your PayPal app (see [Webhooks](#webhooks-optional-but-recommended) above).
2. Enter the Webhook ID in the plugin settings.
3. Alternatively, the order status is also updated during the capture step — if the customer completed checkout successfully, check whether the order status was set at that time.

### "Currency not supported" error

**Cause:** Your store's active currency is not in PayPal's supported currency list.

**Solution:** Switch your store to a [supported currency](#supported-currencies) or configure a separate currency for PayPal-eligible customers.

### Refund fails with an error

**Cause:** The PayPal capture ID is missing from the order, or the transaction has already been refunded.

**Solution:**
1. Open the order and check that a Transaction ID is recorded.
2. If the Transaction ID is empty, the payment may not have been captured correctly. Check the debug log.
3. Log in to your PayPal Business account and verify the transaction status there.

### Dashboard shows "PayPal is in Sandbox mode" warning

**Cause:** **Use PayPal Sandbox** is set to **Yes**.

**Solution:** If you are ready to go live, open the PayPal plugin settings and switch **Use PayPal Sandbox** to **No**, then enter your live credentials.
